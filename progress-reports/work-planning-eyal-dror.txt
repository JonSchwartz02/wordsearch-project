missions:
--------
frontend
--------
- add sentence finder feedback (messages such as sentence finder has finished running, didn't find any sentences etc.)
- add EN localization (globe icon in the left-hand corner of the navbar which will toggle/dropdown options,
  upon changing options the text direction will be changed accordingly 
  and every text displayed to the user should be extracted into a languages json file)
- add thanks page with pictures and brief bios of everyone involved (wait for approval from Igor)
-------
backend
-------
- better dictionary (the dictionary should have approx. 50,000 words which will significantly reduce runtime)
- add the torah/bible as available texts
-------
cloud
-------
- upload project to cloud
- ci-cd?
-------
backlog
-------
- design a way to generate more texts for a text control group (should coordinate with Igor first)
- the sheer volume of texts and found sentences might be overwhelming for the poor aws server, we might have to
  find a big-data reliant solution to overcome this issue (or find an arabic solution instead).
  one possible idea is to change run_find_all_MP and get_sentence_trees_MP to use multithreading instead,
  and have an overarching process that spawns sub-processes for each instance of the sentence finder function.
  further research about parallel computing may be necessary
